👨‍💻 Tech Enthusiast

I'm currently a Shopify Developer in Montreal 🌆 where I work on Product Customization and Site Performance.

In 2020, I was a SWE intern at [Shopee](https://shopee.ph/), the largest e-com platform in southeast asia, working on proof of payment automation, where I built a first-of-a-kind script that perform's OCR on user-submitted receipts and verifies it's legitimacy via cross-checking.
